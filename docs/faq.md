# Frequently asked questions

**Why would you call the software "damage"?**

* Command line utility names are not easy to remember. Typing 'damage [filename'] for the first time will burn the name into your memory.

**Can I rename the program?**

* If you don't like the *frisson* of danger from the name, you can rename the binary files to whatever you like. `manifest_generator` is an obvious, if lengthy choice.

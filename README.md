# File manifest tools: Damage and FCheck

Damage is a simple command-line utility which outputs a file manifest in a variety of formats, with a special focus on statistical package files from SPSS, SAS and Stata. FCheck is the Python 3 module which powers the damage utility, which you can use in your own python code.

Source code, documentation and binary files are available at <https://github.com/ubc-library-rc/fcheck> in the intuitively named subdirectories. 

A less utilitarian documentation viewing experience is available at <https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/fcheck>.
